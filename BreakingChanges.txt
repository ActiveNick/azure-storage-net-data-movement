Tracking Breaking Changes since 0.2.0

  - Removed directory downloading/copying interfaces without DownloadOptions/CopyOptions
  - Changed the return value for directory transferring interfaces from Task to Task<TransferStatus>. 
    This will no longer throw an exception if any of the subtransfers fail. 
    In addition, you can now get the count for transferred files, failed files, and skipped files. 
    If you'd like to see the detailed reason for a subtransfer failure, please use the FileFailed event in TransferContext.
